Building on a lower power Raspberry Pi, like a Zero 2, can be very slow.
One solution is to use distcc to offload the compilation to another faster device.

First setup distcc on the device that will do the building. It should be on your
local network, and capable of compiling either natively or "cross" to aarch64-linux-gnu,
with the same compiler version your build target. Install distcc from the package manager,
then run: sudo dpkg-reconfigure distcc. From the UI, enable the daemon, set the allowed
clients to your network (for example 192.168.0.0/16) and the listen interface to 0.0.0.0.

On the target device, also install distcc, then in ~/.distcc/hosts add a single
line with the build device hostname (for example: "laptop.local"). You can setup
multiple build devices by repeating the previous instructions on other devices;
in that case add one hostname per line.

When building, you need to explicitly select distcc.
    Make: make -j<job count> CC="distcc gcc" CXX="distcc g++"
    Meson: CC="distcc gcc" CXX="distcc g++" meson setup ...
    CMake: export CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=distcc CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=distcc

For Make you also need to pass a job count that matches the number of processor
for your distributed build (example: a Pi Zero 2 with a Pi 5 is about 6 jobs).

You can add the CMake environment variables to your ~/.profile so you don't have to
remember next time.

If you're doing cross-compilation, then you will need to use the fully qualified
compiler names: aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc and aarch64-linux-gnu-g++.

If everything is going well, htop should show distcc build tasks on the build device
when you run on a build on your target device.
